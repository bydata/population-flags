What if we displayed the countries as circle-shaped flags and sized them proportionally by their population?<br><br>Welcome to this visualisation of the world's population. In this **Dorling cartogram**, each country is represented by its flag in the shape of a circle, with the size of the circle corresponding to the population of that country. This approach allows us to see relative population sizes in a visually intuitive way.<br><br>**Start scrolling** to explore the population flags of the world.<br><br>

Explore this map by scrolling to gain insight into how populations are distributed across different regions and how each country compares to others. At the end of the page, you have the chance to explore the map yourself in more detail.


**<u>Asia</u>** is the continent with the most people in the world and has grown a lot since 2000. Asia's population has grown from 3.7 billion at the turn of the millennium to *4.7 billion* by 2021. *India and China*, the two countries with the largest population, together make up about one-third of the world's population. Despite a general decline in birth rates across many Asian countries, the sheer size of the population ensures continuous growth. Cities are getting bigger, the economy is getting better, and people are living longer, although some places are struggling with an ageing population. 
[@cr-map-world]{pan-to="-50%,10%" scale-by="1.4"}


**<u>Africa</u>**'s population has seen dramatic growth since 2000. In 2000, the continent had approximately 814 million inhabitants. By 2021, this number surged to around *1.4 billion*, making Africa the second most populous continent. This rapid increase is primarily due to high birth rates and improvements in healthcare that have reduced mortality rates. The population growth rate in Africa remains the highest among all continents, driven by a youthful demographic and large families. Projections suggest that *by 2050, Africa's population could double.*
[@cr-map-world]{pan-to="10%,-35%" scale-by="1.9"}

The population of the **<u>Americas</u>** has exhibited a consistent upward trajectory since 2000. The combined population of North and South America increased from approximately 841 million in 2000 to approximately *1.04 billion* by 2021. The United States, Mexico, and Brazil are the main contributors to this growth, driven by relatively high birth rates and substantial immigration. Canada also experiences growth, albeit at a slower rate. Urbanisation is a significant trend, with many people moving to cities in search of better opportunities, leading to the expansion of urban areas and associated socio-economic challenges. Overall, the Americas display diverse demographic trends, with increasing urban populations and growing diversity shaping the region's social and economic landscapes.
[@cr-map-world]{pan-to="0%,-10%" scale-by="1.1"}

**<u>Europe</u>**'s population dynamics contrast with other continents, as it has experienced relatively slow growth since 2000. The population in 2000 was about 726 million and has increased modestly to around 745 million in 2021. Many European countries face low birth rates and aging populations, leading to demographic challenges such as labor shortages and increased healthcare demands. Some growth has been sustained through immigration. Despite these trends, Europe remains one of the least densely populated continents relative to its economic output and land area.
[@cr-map-world]{pan-to="-5%,70%" scale-by="2.8"}

**<u>Oceania</u>**, including Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific islands, has experienced moderate population growth since 2000. The population of the region has increased from around 31 million to about 44 million by 2021. This growth can be seen as a steady climb up a gentle hill, driven by Australia's immigration policies and economic opportunities, which act as a supportive push. New Zealand also sees steady increases, while many smaller Pacific island nations have varying growth rates due to differing economic conditions and emigration patterns. Oceania's demographic changes are influenced by both natural population growth and migration, shaping the region's diverse and dynamic population landscape.
